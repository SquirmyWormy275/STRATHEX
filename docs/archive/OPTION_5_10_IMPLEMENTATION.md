- Rows: All competitors
- Columns: All events
- Symbols: ✓ = Paid, ✗ = Unpaid, - = Not entered
- Easy visual scanning of payment status

**Example Grid:**
```
Competitor                      | 225mm SB   | 300mm UH   | 375mm SB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Smith                      |     ✓      |     ✗      |     ✓
Jane Doe                        |     ✓      |     ✓      |     -
Bob Johnson                     |     ✗      |     ✗      |     ✓
```

### Menu Integration

**Multi-Event Tournament Menu → Option 5: Manage Entry Fees & Payouts**

Submenu:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                   TOURNAMENT FINANCES                          ║

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Progress Tracker Integration

Entry fee tracking appears in the tournament progress tracker:
```
║  ⚠ 7 unpaid entry fees                                         ║
```

### Data Persistence

Entry fee payment status is stored in:
- `tournament_state['tournament_roster'][competitor]['entry_fees_paid']`
- Format: `{event_id: True/False}`
- Auto-saved after marking fees paid

### Enable/Disable Fee Tracking

Entry fee tracking is optional:
- Enable during "Setup Tournament Roster" (Option 3)
- If disabled, Option 5 shows warning message
- Can be enabled/disabled per tournament

## 🎯 Option 10: Scratch/Withdrawal Management

### Overview
Comprehensive system for handling day-of scratches and withdrawals. When competitors don't show up or must withdraw, judges can mark them as scratched, automatically removing them from pending events and tracking the history.

### New File Created
**`woodchopping/ui/scratch_management.py`** (450 lines)

### Features

#### 1. **View All Competitors with Status**
Shows complete roster with:
- Competitor name
- Status (✓ Active or ✗ SCRATCHED)
- Number of events entered
- Summary counts

#### 2. **Mark Competitor as Scratched**

**Workflow:**
1. Select competitor from active roster
2. Shows events they're entered in
3. Choose scratch reason (or enter custom):
   - Injury
   - Personal emergency
   - No-show
   - Equipment failure
   - Other (custom text)
4. Confirm action
5. System automatically:
   - Marks competitor as scratched
   - Removes from all pending events
   - Removes from pending heats/rounds
   - Updates competitor_status in events
   - Logs to scratch history with timestamp
   - Auto-saves tournament

**Confirmation Screen:**
```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  CONFIRM SCRATCH
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Competitor: John Smith
  Reason: Injury
  Will be removed from 3 event(s)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Confirm scratch? (yes/no): _
```

#### 3. **View Scratch History**
Complete log of all scratches for the tournament:
- Competitor name
- Scratch reason
- Timestamp
- Number of events affected
- Permanent record for post-tournament review

#### 4. **Restore Scratched Competitor (Undo)**
Accidentally scratched wrong person? Restore them:
- Select from scratched competitors
- Restores to active status
- Re-adds to event rosters
- Updates competitor_status back to 'active'
- Note: Must manually regenerate heats if needed

**Use Cases:**
- Judge accidentally scratched wrong competitor
- Competitor shows up after being marked no-show
- Equipment issue resolved, competitor can compete

### Menu Structure

**Multi-Event Tournament Menu → Option 10: Manage Scratches/Withdrawals**

```

║  5. Return to Main Menu                                        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Progress Tracker Integration

Scratch count appears in tournament progress tracker:
```
║  ⚠ 2 competitor(s) scratched                                   ║
```

### Automatic Event Removal

When a competitor is scratched, the system automatically:
1. **Removes from event.all_competitors list** - No longer in event roster
2. **Updates event.competitor_status[name] = 'scratched'** - Marked in event
3. **Removes from pending rounds** - Not in future heats/semis/finals
4. **Removes from round.competitors list** - Not assigned to any heat
5. **Removes from round.handicap_results** - No handicap data displayed

**Important:** Only removes from **pending** rounds. If competitor already competed in a heat, their results are preserved for historical records.

### Data Persistence

Scratch data is stored in:
- `tournament_state['tournament_roster'][competitor]['status']` = 'scratched'
- `tournament_state['tournament_roster'][competitor]['scratch_reason']` = reason
- `tournament_state['tournament_roster'][competitor]['scratch_timestamp']` = ISO timestamp
- `tournament_state['scratch_history']` = [{competitor_name, reason, timestamp, events_affected}]

### Future Enhancement Note

Currently shows note: "Please regenerate heats manually if needed"

**Future:** Could automatically trigger heat regeneration after scratch, but needs careful handling of:
- In-progress vs pending rounds
- Bracket tournaments (need bye assignment)
- Multi-event coordination
